# Python-game
Using python3, The game was made by python's 'pygame' module.

- To start the game you need to provide the initial size of the pattern.

- It takes approximately 1.2 seconds between two successor numbers.

-There are two files.

1)game.py -game without sound effects

"Reason why I seperated: Because when I tried the program on my ubuntu, it didn't support the
 sound files. But it works very well on windows."

- To compile: (Need to install pygame first)

-> python3 game.py

OR

-> python3 game_sound.py

-Enjoy
